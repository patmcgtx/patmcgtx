Interested mostly in  development (Swift, Xcode, iOS). 

I've been making apps for companies for my day job for a while now.  This account has my early solo apps and some after-hours projects.

Check out my ongoing [software development notes](https://patmcg.com/category/software-dev/).

I also like to [take pictures](https://patmcg.com/category/photos/) 📸 and [make music](https://patmcg.com/category/songs/) 🎤 and am a [proud dad](https://mcgkids.blog).
