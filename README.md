👋 Hi, I’m @patmcgtx from Austin, Texas. 🌮🤠

👀 I’m interested in -oriented development (Swift, Xcode, iOS).

🌱 I’m currently learning macOS development and SwiftUI.

🧑🏻‍💻 Check out my [software development notes](https://patmcg.com/category/software-dev/) on [my personal blog](https://patmcg.com/).

📸 Just for fun, sometimes I put some [photos on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/patmcgtx/).  

🎸 I also like to [make music](https://patmcg.com/category/songs/) when time allows.  You could call me a struggling musician. 😛

👨🏻‍🏭 My professional profile is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patmcgtx/).
