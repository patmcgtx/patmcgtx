Hi, I’m @patmcgtx from Austin, Texas. 🌮

↪

I’m interested in -oriented development (Swift, Xcode, iOS).

I’m currently learning macOS development and SwiftUI. 🧑🏻‍💻

Check out my [software development notes](https://patmcg.com/category/software-dev/) on [my blog](https://patmcg.com/).

I started making iOS apps [on my own](https://www.roundtripsoftware.com/news/) a while back and have since been lucky enough to make apps for [big companies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patmcgtx/). 👨🏻‍🏭

Just for fun, sometimes I put [photos on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/patmcgtx/). 📸

I also like to [make music](https://patmcg.com/category/songs/) when time allows. 🎸  You could call me a struggling musician. 🤷🏻‍♂️


✌️
